# Naming Conventions and Styling 
- Flux Functions:
In text blocks Flux functions should be referred to by their name, followed by parentheses, and the word "function". For example:

Most Flux queries start with the from() function and end with a yield() function. 

- Telegraf Plugins:
The name of the plugin should be capitalized. The type of plugin, nor the word plugin, need not be capitalized. For example:

The Execd processor plugin runs and external program in the language of your choice. 

- UI Components 
All references to UI components should be capitalized. All named UI components should been indicated by bold font. For example:
The **Explorer** page allows you to query and visualize your data.  

# Syntax Highlated Code Blocks and Code formating
- Flux code blocks are styled with `js`
- cURL requests are styled `h`
- Python code blocs are styled with `python` 

# Links 
When introducing new terms or well documented concepts, links should be applied to these terms the fist time they appear in each section. For subsquent mentions of the term or concept a link need not be applied.
